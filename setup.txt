I created this file a little late, so I will need to update this with what I learn
from setting up again on the dev server.

Off the top of my head...

WINDOWS
- Download version of Python 3 (I'm using 3.4 currently)
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Update your PATH variable (C:/PythonXX;C:/PythonXX/Scripts)
- At this point it might be a good idea to setup a virtualenv. I, however, did not do this
    - http://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide/blob/master/docs/dev/virtualenvs.rst
- Install MySQL (Including the workbench and other packages for dev)
    - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/
    - You DON'T need the Oracle account, click the 'No thanks, just start my download.' link at the bottom
    - I skipped the VIsual Studio requirements...
- Download (the latest?) version of Django
    - pip install Django (from the command line, not the python interpreter)
- Download MySQL-Python
    - pip install MySQL-python
    - !NOTE! I was having issues with this (unable to find vcvarsall.bat) so I did the following:
        - Install the correct mysqlclient file from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient
        - pip install wheel
        - pip install path_to_installed_mysqlclient_file
- Download pillow (for ImageFields)
    - pip install Pillow
- Setup your MySQL Server
    - Create a schema and user account defined in the local.py settings file
    - Make sure this user account has the correct privelages (not a DB Admin)
- Git setup
    - Download Git / Github / whatever Git client you prefer to clone the application locally
    - Load the application into PyCharm (or whatever other IDE you are using)
    - Sync / Migrate the database https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/
        - manage.py makemigrations
        - manage.py migrate
- Start the server
    - manage.py runserver
