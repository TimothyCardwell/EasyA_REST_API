I created this file a little late, so I will need to update this with what I learn
from setting up again on the dev server.

Off the top of my head...

WINDOWS
- Download (the latest?) version of Python 3
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Update your PATH variable (C:/PythonXX;C:/PythonXX/Scripts)
- !NOTE! The following two steps are not required if downloading Python 3.4 or above
	- Run the following script to get easy_install
		- https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
	- Run the following script to get pip (because easy install is deprecated)
		- https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
- At this point it might be a good idea to setup a virtualenv. I, however, did not do this
    - http://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide/blob/master/docs/dev/virtualenvs.rst
- Install MySQL (Including the workbench and other packages for dev)
    - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/
    - You DON'T need the Oracle account, click the 'No thanks, just start my download.' link at the bottom
    - I skipped the VIsual Studio requirements...
- Download (the latest?) version of Django
    - pip install Django (from the command line, not the python interpreter)
- Download MySQL-Python
    - pip install MySQL-python
